    // Set to 100 to avoid long wait times in case queue is full
    // Causes instant RejectedExecutionException that can then be use in UI to tell
    // the user the system is overloaded and that they should try again in a few seconds.
    // If we set it to 500 the task would get added to the queue, and the user would sit and wait
    // for potentially a long time. So by limiting it to what a max (Millisecond) response time should
    // be, we can create a better and more UI friendly system that allows users to know exactly what's
    // going on without thinking their internet is having issues or whatever they might think.

    //
    // 0L
    //      - 0 = 0 extra cashiers can be added if the shop is super busy
    //      - L = Long

    // in Seconds, Hours, Milliseconds and so on.

    //      - We have 100 tasks in queue and 4 active customers being helped. This means our System is at fully
    //      - capacity. If we allow any more customers in the shop at this given state of time the shop would cave in.

            // 1. You're driving a series of cars (Threads). Your boss (System) presses a button that enables
            //    the "STOP DRIVING" lamp in your cars dashboard...
            //
            // 2. You can't just BRAKE and STOP instantly, so you wait for a safe spot to pull over.
            //    (finish current Thread)
            //
            // 3. You're now parked for 5sec waiting for the rest of the cars to park their car aswell...
            //
            // 4. While you're waiting (5sec) you're hit by an unexpected car. Your cars electricity fails
            //    and your "STOP DRIVING" lamp isn't working anymore and you can't remember if it was ON or OFF.
            //
            // 5. Your car has a feature (Thread.currentThread().interrupt()) that re-enables the system as
            //    it was pre-crash.
            //

            // 7. Without (Thread.currentThread().interrupt()) your system wouldn't reboot and your "STOP DRIVING"
            //    lamp would be off. Since you can't remember if it was ON or OFF pre-crash you're just assuming
            //    it was off, so you continue your task (Thread) as it was before which would cause a leak.
            //
            // 8. It's important to handle leaks as they can be resource heavy and use RAM / cause Database Connectivity
            //    issues which is a big problem. So by handling the leak we're able to shut down our program in a
            //    efficient way without causing any subtle or worst yet... unknown leaks.
